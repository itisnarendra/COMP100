    "-   Think of it like a remote control: When you press the 'Volume Up' button, the volume increases. You don't need to know how the circuit board, infrared signal, and TV processor work internally-you only interact with the simple interface (the button). The complexity is hidden.\n",

    "-   **Maintainability**: Internal changes don’t affect external usage.\n",
    "-   **Security**: sensitive logic remains hidden.\n",
    "-   **Structure Enforcement**: Ensures subclasses follow a consistent design.\n",

    "Python achieves abstraction primarily through two mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating Abstract Classes and Methods\n",
    "    -   An Abstract Class is a class that cannot be instantiated (you can't create an object directly from it). \n",
    "        -   It's designed to be a blueprint or template for other classes.\n",
    "        -   May contain Abstract methods\n",
    "        -   May also contain concrete methods\n",
    "    -   An Abstract Method is a method that has a declaration (a name, parameters) but no definition (no actual code/body). Subclasses must provide the definition (the implementation) for these methods.\n",
    "        -   Python's abc module: Python uses the built-in abc (Abstract Base Classes) module to define abstract classes and methods.\n",
    "        -   Key tools:\n",
    "            -   ABC: A metaclass used to define an abstract class.\n",
    "            -   @abstractmethod: A decorator used to declare a method as abstract.\n",
