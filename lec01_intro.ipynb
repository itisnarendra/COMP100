    "A notebook is an interactive document format that integrates executable code, rich output, and descriptive text (Markdown) into a single cohesive file. It provided an environment for inteative development, data analysis and documentation. These notebooks are supported by VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab.\n",

    "These notebooks are structured as a sequence of cells, which can be:\n",
    "1.  Code Cells: These contains executable code that can be run independently or in sequence\n",
    "1.  Markdown Cells: These contains formatted text using Markdown syntax, allowing for explanations, comments and narratibve alongside the code.\n",
    "1.  Rich Output: When code cells are executed, their output are displayed directly below the cells, giving the user a dynamic and interactive experience.\n",

    "### Interacting with the Notebook\n",
    "1.  To execute a code cell, click the icon at the top-left of the cell\n",
