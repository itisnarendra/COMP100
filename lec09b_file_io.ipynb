    "### Using Different Encodings\n",
    "In Python, encoding in file writing refers to the way text characters are converted into bytes before being stored in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write to a file in text mode, Python takes your string (which internally uses Unicode) and encodes it into a sequence of bytes according to the specified character encoding scheme — like UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why encoding matters\n",
    "Computers store files as bytes, but human-readable text is made of characters.    \n",
    "Different encodings map characters to bytes differently.    \n",
    "If you choose the wrong encoding when writing, the file might not display correctly when read later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Encodings\n",
    "| Encoding  | Description   | Use Case |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| UTF-8     | Universal, supports all Unicode characters | Recommended default |\n",
    "| ASCII     | Limited basic English chracters            | Legacy systems      |    \n",

    "### 1. working with CSV Files\n",
    "CSV files, short for Comma-Separated Values files, are a simple and widely-used format for storing tabular data—like what you’d see in a spreadsheet.   \n",
    "What is a CSV file?   \n",
    "A CSV file is a plain text file where:  \n",
    "-   Each line represents a row of data.\n",
    "-   Each value in the row is separated by a comma (or sometimes another delimiter like a semicolon or tab).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are CSV files important?\n",
    "Here are some key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Simplicity & Universality   \n",
    "CSV files are easy to create, read and edit. Almost every programming language and data tool (like Excel, Google Sheets, databases and programming languages like Python, R, etc.) supports them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Lightweight Format    \n",
    "Since they’re plain text, CSV files are small in size and quick to load, process or transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Easy Data Exchange   \n",
    "They’re ideal for sharing data between different systems or platforms—especially when exporting or importing data from databases, spreadsheets, or web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Human-Readable    \n",
    "You can open a CSV file in any text editor and understand the data without needing special software.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Automation-Friendly    \n",
    "CSVs are often used in data pipelines, machine learning workflows, and automated reporting systems because they’re easy to parse and manipulate programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Integration with analytics tools   \n",
    "Many data analysis tools (Pandas, R, Tableau, Power BI) directly read CSVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of CSV Files\n",
    "-   No support for formatting (colors, formulas, multiple sheets like Excel)\n",
    "-   Can’t handle complex data relationships (like a database)\n",
    "-   Risk of errors if data contains commas or line breaks"
